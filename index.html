<h2>About Andrew!!</h2>

</header>
<hr>
<p> After I graduated High school I didnâ€™t go to college. I went straight into the work force and worked construction for a while. I did not enjoy working construction at all and needed a change. After doing a bunch of research on what I should do I decided I wanted to do something with computers. So then I found Thinkful and did a good amount of research on Thinkful, and figured it was probably my best bet to do something I wanted to do.</p>
<hr>
<p> I also love to fly, my Dad and Grandfather are pilots and I always go flying with them. And I love playing video games!!! I spend a lot of time when I am not working or doing school playing games!!!</p>
